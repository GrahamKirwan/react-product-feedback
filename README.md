## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, read, update, and delete product feedback requests
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit feedback requests
- Sort suggestions by most/least upvotes and most/least comments
- Filter suggestions by category
- Add comments and replies to a product feedback request
- Upvote product feedback requests
- **Bonus**: Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Hooks, Context, Router
- Local storage
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- Flexbox & CSS Grid
- Figma for design
- Vercel for deployment


### What I learned

My goal with this project was to just build a React project and get comfortable with something a little more robust, as my last few projects have been vanilla JavaScript. Just wanted to continue working, learning, improving, make something similar to my last React app, and see how I'm progressing. I wanted to focus on keeping components and functions small and clean.


### Continued development

I would like to come back to this project and add user auth and possibly connect it to a database. Also, my code could have been commented better as i was just trying to hack through the project and become familiar with react as fast as possible without taking any shortcuts.
